    <h1>Lets Dive right in!</h1>
    <p>Fun Fact: Roly Polys are not insects they are <b>crustaceans</b>!!</p>
    <p>Isopod basics:</p>
    <p>What they are: Isopods are a type of crustacean, meaning they are more closely related to lobsters and crabs than to insects.</p>
    <p>What they eat: They are <b>detritivores</b>, meaning they feed on <b>dead organic matter like decaying leaves, wood, and even animal waste</b></p>
    <p>Whare they live: moist, dark, and sheltered environments, with a focus on organic substrates and hiding places.</p>
    <p>How to care for them:
    Isopods need a stable environment with appropriate humidity, ventilation, and a source of food and water.</p>
